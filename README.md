# Bedrock

In the coming months, I will be building a lot of websites. More specifically — WordPress themes. Normally when I build a new WordPress theme, I start with [Underscores](http://underscores.me/), but I want to use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to get me off the ground. I found [this cool project](https://github.com/holger1411/understrap) by [holger1411](https://github.com/holger1411) that combined Underscores and Bootstrap. Now, I want my boilerplate to be a little different, so that’s why I forked the project and renamed it Bedrock. Bedrock will be my starting point for every website.
